        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Lions Clubs International Foundation is "Lions helping Lions serve the world".Donations provide funding in the form of grants to financially assist Lions districts with large-scale humanitarian projects that are too expensive and costly for Lions to finance on their own.The Foundation aids Lions in making a greater impact in their local communities, as well as around the world.Lions Clubs plan and participate in a variety of service projects. Examples include donations to hospices,  or community campaigns such as Message in a bottle, a United Kingdom and Ireland initiative which places a plastic bottle with critical medical information inside the refrigerators of vulnerable people.Money is also raised for international purposes. Some of this is donated in reaction to events such as the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2013 Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) where Lions and LCIF provided disaster relief locally and from around the world, with donations and commitments surpassing US$1 million.</p>
